# Forage - British Airways Virtual Internship

* It’s an exciting time to be at British Airways. We’re growing our global route network, investing in our fleet and transforming the experience we offer customers. We are a 24-hour business, operating 365 days of the year, all around the world. It’s a dynamic, fast-paced environment that will bring out the best in you – if you’re ready to embrace responsibility and step up to any challenge. Wherever you join us, you’ll feel proud to play a part in our future as we go further to be the airline of choice. 

* During this programme, you will have the opportunity to step into the shoes of a British Airways team member and complete tasks that replicate the work that our Data Science team does every day. You’ll learn how to scrape customer review data and build predictive models.

* We hope this programme provides a great resource for you to upskill and strengthen your resume as you explore career options and a potential career at British Airways!

# Tasks Performed
* In task one, Customer Review Analysis and Sentiment Analysis was done by webscrapping reviews [Task 1](https://github.com/Swam80/BritishAirways_Internship/tree/main/Task%201)


## In task two, predictive modelling was performed to predict customer bookings.
* Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

* This is possible with the use of data and predictive models. The most important factor with a predictive model is the quality of the data you use to train the machine learning algorithms. For this task, you must manipulate and prepare the provided customer booking data so that you can build a high-quality predictive model.

* With your predictive model, it is important to interpret the results in order to understand how “predictive” the data really was and whether we can feasibly use it to predict the target outcome (customers buying holidays). Therefore, you should evaluate the model's performance and output how each variable contributes to the predictive model's power.
